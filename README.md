Baseball Stats
==============

Baseball/Softball team manager, schedule manager and statistic tracker. Wordpress plugin

I created this plugin for a local client (http://lethmixedslowpitch.com) and at this moment it is designed specifically for them. My goal for this project is to make the plugin customizable for any baseball/softball league to be able to use and customize to their needs. This is also my first real use of Github so I will be learning as I go! Any help will be greatly appreciated as I hope to give back to the Wordpress community and hopefully collaborate with some great developers through this project.

TODO (lots):

* Write code to generate database.
* Remove instances of "LMSA" and make this customizable or just generic.
* Add ability to specify number of divisions (this is hardcoded in right now)

* More...
